        <h1>Differences Between Single-Row Functions and Aggregate Functions</h1>

        <div class="difference">
            <h3>1. Application Scope</h3>
            <p>Single-row functions operate on single rows of data and return a single result per row. They are applied to each row individually within a query.</p>
            <p>Aggregate functions, on the other hand, operate on multiple rows of data and return a single result for the entire set of rows. They are typically used with the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause to group the rows into subsets for calculation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="difference">
            <h3>2. Result Type</h3>
            <p>Single-row functions return a single value for each row processed by the query. These values can be of various data types, depending on the function's operation and the input data.</p>
            <p>Aggregate functions, however, return a single result based on the entire set of rows processed by the query. The result is usually a summary value, such as the average, sum, count, maximum, or minimum of a column's values.</p>
