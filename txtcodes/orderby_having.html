        <h1>Purpose of ORDER BY and HAVING Clauses in SQL</h1>
        
        <h2>i) ORDER BY Clause</h2>
        <p>The <code>ORDER BY</code> clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns. The sorting can be in ascending (<code>ASC</code>) or descending (<code>DESC</code>) order. By default, the sorting is in ascending order if no order is specified.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Results:</strong> The primary purpose is to organize the query results in a specific order.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhancing Readability:</strong> Makes it easier to read and analyze the results, especially when dealing with large datasets.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <pre><code>SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code>SELECT first_name, last_name, age
FROM students
ORDER BY last_name ASC, age DESC;</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the results are sorted first by <code>last_name</code> in ascending order, and then by <code>age</code> in descending order within each <code>last_name</code>.</p>
        
        <h2>ii) HAVING Clause</h2>
        <p>The <code>HAVING</code> clause is used to filter records that have been aggregated by the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause. It is similar to the <code>WHERE</code> clause, but <code>HAVING</code> is used to filter groups rather than individual rows.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filtering Groups:</strong> It allows for conditions to be applied to groups of rows created by the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregate Functions:</strong> It is typically used with aggregate functions (e.g., <code>SUM</code>, <code>COUNT</code>, <code>AVG</code>) to filter groups based on aggregate values.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <pre><code>SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code>SELECT department, COUNT(employee_id) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 10;</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the query retrieves the departments that have more than 10 employees. The <code>HAVING</code> clause filters the groups formed by <code>GROUP BY</code> based on the aggregate count of <code>employee_id</code>.</p>
