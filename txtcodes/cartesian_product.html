        <h1>Understanding Cartesian Product in MySQL</h1>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>The Cartesian Product, also known as a cross join, is a mathematical operation that combines every row of one table with every row of another table. In MySQL, when you perform a cross join between two tables without specifying any join condition, you get a Cartesian Product.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Consider two tables: <code>table1</code> with columns <code>column1</code> and <code>table2</code> with columns <code>column2</code>. Performing a Cartesian Product between these two tables results in a new table with every possible combination of rows from <code>table1</code> and <code>table2</code>.</p>
            <p>The SQL query for a Cartesian Product looks like this:</p>
            <div class="code-container">
                <code>SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;</code>
            </div>
            <p>This query will return a result set where each row from <code>table1</code> is paired with every row from <code>table2</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="usage">
            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>Cartesian Products are rarely used in practice because they can produce a large number of rows, especially when dealing with tables with many rows. They are more commonly used when you intentionally need every possible combination of rows from two tables.</p>
            <p>However, it's important to note that accidentally producing a Cartesian Product in a query can lead to unexpected and unintended results, as it can significantly increase the size of the result set.</p>
